d3Launcher is a mod Launcher for Doom3 and it's port dhewm3.

It's main features are the following:
* It will auto-detect any mod directories and if there is a .bat file in them by the mod author (or you) it will add a launcher using the argument on the .bat file.
* You may edit/create/hide launchers in the app.
* If it detects the main Doom3/dhewm3 executable in the launcher's arguments it offers the ability to connect on a selected IP and Port on launcher's execution.
* It will add the relevant entries for launching the client or server executables of Doom3/dhewm3 automatically on it's launcher items.

You may override the Doom3/dhewm3 path autodetection by saving a file named 'override.ini' in the d3launcher directory. It has to contain only something like this:
`D:/Games/dhewm3/`


If there is demand, which I doubt, I will create a Linux version as well.
